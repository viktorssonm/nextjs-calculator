This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Wanted to check out nextJS with CSS modules. At the same time get a JavaScript challenge. Implemeted a simple calculator with some inspiration from iOS calculator.
